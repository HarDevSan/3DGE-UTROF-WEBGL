// If you got this asset from a pirate site, please consider buying it from the Unity asset store. This asset is only legally available from the Unity Asset Store.
// 
// I'm a single indie dev supporting my family by spending hundreds and thousands of hours on this and other assets. It's very offensive, rude and just plain evil to steal when I (and many others) put so much hard work into the software.

// Thank you.
